# Grocery
### What Does This App Do?

Imagine you have a list of groceries. This app takes that list and displays it in a neat, organized table. It also gives you two tools to manage this list:

1.  A **search bar** to quickly find items by name.
2.  A **checkbox** to show only the items that are currently in stock.

It’s a simple but powerful way to see how a modern web application works.

### How to Build This Application from Scratch

If you wanted to create this project yourself, you would start with a tool called **Create React App**. It sets up a new React project with all the necessary files and configurations, so you can start coding right away.

1.  **Open Your Terminal (or Command Prompt):** This is the command-line interface for your computer.
2.  **Run the Create React App command:** This command creates a new folder called `grocery-app` with a starter React project inside it.
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app grocery-app
    ```
3.  **Navigate into Your New Project:**
    ```bash
    cd grocery-app
    ```
4.  **Open `src/App.js`:** This is the main file you'll be editing. You can replace its contents with the code from the `App.js` file you provided.
5.  **Open `src/App.css`:** Replace the contents of this file with the CSS code you provided to style your app.
6.  **Start the App:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the application in your browser, and you'll see your grocery list app in action\!

### Understanding the Code in `App.js`

Think of a React app as being built with LEGO bricks. Each brick is a **component**. A component is a piece of your user interface that is reusable and manages its own content. In our app, we have five components.

#### 1\. `App` (The Main Component)

This is the top-level component that holds everything together. It's like the main box that contains all the other LEGO pieces. Its only job is to render the `FilterableProductTable` and provide it with the full list of products.

#### 2\. `FilterableProductTable` (The App's Container)

This component is the "brain" of our application. It does two very important things:

  * It holds the `SearchBar` and the `ProductTable`.
  * It keeps track of what the user is searching for and whether they want to see only in-stock items. This is called **state**.

**What is `state`?**
State is simply data that can change over time. In our app, when you type into the search bar, the `filterText` state changes. When you click the checkbox, the `inStockOnly` state changes. React automatically re-renders the components whenever their state changes.

We create state using the `useState` hook:

```javascript
const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');
const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);
```

  * `useState('')` initializes `filterText` with an empty string.
  * `useState(false)` initializes `inStockOnly` to `false`.
  * `setFilterText` and `setInStockOnly` are functions we use to update these state values.

#### 3\. `SearchBar` (The User's Controls)

This component contains the search input field and the checkbox. It doesn't have its own memory (state). Instead, it receives its values and functions from its parent, `FilterableProductTable`. This is done through **props**.

**What are `props`?**
Props (short for properties) are like instructions you pass to a component. The `FilterableProductTable` tells the `SearchBar` what the current search text is and whether the checkbox is checked. It also gives the `SearchBar` the functions to call when the user interacts with it.

```javascript
// In FilterableProductTable
<SearchBar 
  filterText={filterText} 
  inStockOnly={inStockOnly} 
  onFilterTextChange={setFilterText} 
  onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly} />
```

Here, `filterText`, `inStockOnly`, `onFilterTextChange`, and `onInStockOnlyChange` are all props.

#### 4\. `ProductTable` (The Grocery List Display)

This component is responsible for displaying the rows of products. It receives the full list of products and the current `filterText` and `inStockOnly` values from `FilterableProductTable`. It then filters the list based on these values and displays the result.

#### 5\. `ProductCategoryRow` and `ProductRow` (The Table Rows)

  * **`ProductCategoryRow`** is a simple component that displays a heading for a category (like "Fruits").
  * **`ProductRow`** displays a single product's name and price. If a product is out of stock (`stocked: false`), it displays its name in red.

### The Flow of Data (Putting It All Together)

This is the most important concept to understand in this app.

1.  **User Interaction:** The user types "Apple" into the search bar.
2.  **Event Happens:** The `onChange` event on the `<input>` element in the `SearchBar` is triggered.
3.  **State is Updated:** The `SearchBar` calls the `onFilterTextChange` function (which is actually the `setFilterText` function from `FilterableProductTable`). This updates the `filterText` state in `FilterableProductTable` to be "Apple".
4.  **React Re-renders:** Because the state of `FilterableProductTable` has changed, React re-renders it and all of its children.
5.  **Props are Passed Down:** The new `filterText` value ("Apple") is passed down as a prop to both the `SearchBar` (so it shows the text you typed) and the `ProductTable`.
6.  **UI is Updated:** The `ProductTable` receives the new prop, filters the product list to only include items with "Apple" in their name, and displays the new, filtered list.

This entire process happens almost instantly, creating a seamless and interactive experience for the user. This is called a **one-way data flow**, and it's a fundamental pattern in React.

### Styling the App

The visual appearance of the app is controlled by the CSS files:

  * **`src/index.css`**: Contains very basic styles for the entire page.
  * **`src/App.css`**: Contains all the specific styles for our components, like the colors, spacing, and layout of the search bar and product table. Each component in `App.js` has a `className` that corresponds to a style rule in this file.
